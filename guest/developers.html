        A common complain with standard UUIDs are that they are unreadable.
        This no longer has to be the case. This small web service will
        generate a human-friendly UUID, which is easily readable 
        and perfectly valid. It will generate a UUID looking like:
        20141219-1003-1033-473572-808278214600. Benefits of using:
        easily readable; by looking at it provides date and time
        information when was generated; can be ordered by date of creation;
        UUID valid.
        You may also choose to store the value in the database using
        the provided bases -- Base10, Base16, Base32, Base36, Base62,
        Base64, Base75 -- thus saving extra space.
        Available in JSON and JSONP.
